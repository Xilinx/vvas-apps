# VVAS compositor plugin

vvas_xcompositor is plugin that combines two or more video streams into a single frame using hardware mutiscaler 2.0 kernel. 

### Input & output
It can accept NV12 video streams. For each of the requested sink pads it will compare the incoming geometry and framerate to define the output parameters. Indeed output video frames will have the geometry of the biggest incoming video stream and the framerate of the fastest incoming one.

vvas_xompositor will do colorspace conversion.

### Individual parameters for each input stream can be configured on the GstCompositorPad:

- "xpos": The x-coordinate position of the top-left corner of the picture (#gint)
- "ypos": The y-coordinate position of the top-left corner of the picture (#gint)
- "width": The width of the picture; the input will be scaled if necessary (#gint)
- "height": The height of the picture; the input will be scaled if necessary (#gint)
- "zorder": The z-order position of the picture in the composition (#guint)
